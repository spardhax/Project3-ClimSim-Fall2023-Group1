+ Project summary: In this project, we attempted to understand the ClimSim GitHub repository in more detail and explore different avenues for training machine learning algorithms to the data.

**Contribution Statement** Julia Blake reproduced the quickstart notebook and donwloaded/subset the data for us to use in the future steps. Manan Brahmbhatt reproduced the quickstart notebook using R by implementing the Python data_utils package and adapting it for R. Spardha Sharma worked on implementing the quickstart notebook in HuggingFace for an even quicker start. Yuchen Wu and Wenhe Chen worked on implementing a Machine Learning model on the data. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
